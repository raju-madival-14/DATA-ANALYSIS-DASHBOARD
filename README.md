## Project objective 

A Road Accident Dashboard is an interactive data visualization designed to monitor, analyse, and present key statistics related to road traffic accidents. It typically displays real-time or historical data such as the number of accidents, fatalities, injuries, accident locations, time trends, causes, and vehicle types involved. The dashboard helps stakeholders like traffic authorities, policymakers, and the public gain insights into accident patterns, identify high-risk areas, and implement safety measures to reduce road accidents.
